### Other info:
This is a Minecraft server plugin, which means the [plugin jar file](https://github.com/hongxiw/ClimateChangeWarnings/releases/tag/v1.0) must be put into the plugins folder of a Minecraft server to work
- You will need at least a [Spigot server](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/spigot-installation/)
- A [Paper server](https://papermc.io/) also works
